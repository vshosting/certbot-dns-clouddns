## Contributing Code
If this is your first time contributing code on Github, take a look at Github's [How to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). After you read it, you follow this checklist to make a pull request:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Setup development environment using `poetry install`
3. Run the tests using `poetry run pytest` to make sure they pass on your system.
4. Write tests for the code you are changing. It should fail.
5. Change to the code.
6. Run the test suite again, ensuring all tests, including the ones you have written, pass.
7. Make a pull request on Github.

### Code Style
- certbot-dns-clouddns adheres to [Pep 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding conventions.
- Follow [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with the exception of using [Sphinx-style documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
- Use imports for packages and modules only.
- Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
